# 🗺 Jacki's Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! Here, I document a summary of my projects with hyperlinks to each repository for easy access.

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| 💬 [NLP Sentiment Classifier](https://github.com/jackiwynter/NLP-Sentiment-Classifier) | Python, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib | Sentiment analysis project leveraging NLP techniques to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, featuring custom wordlist-based and Naive Bayes classifiers, evaluated through precision, recall, and F1 scores. |
| 🌾 [Crop Export Value MLP](https://github.com/jackiwynter/Crop-Export-Value-MLP) | Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy| Developed a multilayer perceptron model to forecast crop export values three years ahead, featuring advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, and robust evaluation metrics for performance assessment. |
| 🚴‍♀️ [Physical Activity Regression Model](https://github.com/jackiwynter/Physical-Activity-Regression-Model) | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (for feature selection), Statsmodels (for linear regression) | Developed a predictive model to estimate MET scores using data from the Colibri Wireless unit, leveraging features like heart rate, temperature, and gyroscope readings. The model demonstrated strong predictive power and led to the development of a fitness tracking software for enhanced user experience. |
